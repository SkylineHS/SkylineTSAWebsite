    <h2>DigiForge Technology Conference</h2>
    <p>February 9, 2015 by Mr. Kapptie</p>
    <p>Thursday, March 19, 2015 8:00 am - 12:30 pm @ SLCC's South City Campus</p>
    <p>Let’s do some math.  In 2013, only 61 students in Utah took the AP Computer Science test. That same year, 35,721 AP tests were taken in Utah.  So for every 585 AP tests taken, only 1 AP CS test was taken.  Ok, you get the point.  Clearly we have some work to do to get more students into tech.  The good news is that on March 13, 2014, over 600 students will attend the DigiForge Student Conference, aka #UtahDigiCon.  This conference will expose more students to technology learning, hopefully igniting their interest in technology careers.  Cydni Tetro, Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Disney, will be the keynote speaker.  She also co-founded Women Tech Council. </p>
    <p>DigiForge Student Conference 2014 will include topics on</p>
    <li>Game Design</li>
    <li>Design - Digital Art</li>
    <li>Programming</li>
    <li>Women in Tech</li>
    <li>Networking</li>
    <li>Database Admin/Development</li>
    <p>The students can attend three different interactive sessions and see the latest and greatest in technology.  High school students in Canyons, Granite, Jordan, Murray, Salt Lake, Tooele School Districts welcome.</p>
