    <h2>What is TSA?</h2>
    <p>The Technology Student Association (TSA) is a national student organization devoted exclusively to the needs of students who are engaged in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).</p>
    <h2>School Chapters</h2>
    <p>TSA chapters take the study of STEM beyond the classroom and allows students the chance to pursue their interests among friends with similar goals and interests. Together, chapter members work on competitive events, attend conferences on the state and national levels and have a good time raising funds to get there. Chapter organization develops leadership, as members may become officers within their state and then run nationally. Our chapters are committed to a national service project and are among the most service-oriented groups in the community.</p>
    <h2>Competitions</h2>
    <p>In order to engage students with the drive to make a difference in the worl, TSA offers activities that captivate and intrigue students into spending hours working on it after school for weeks at a time.  TSA members have the opportunity to compete at exciting state conferences and then the annual National Conference.  These competitions focus on the subjects of science, technology, engineering and math, however can vary greatly to suit the interests of the member.  Students can work individually or as a team member in areas such as agriculture and biotechnology, website design, dragster design, flight challenge, film technology, CAD with 3D modeling, desktop publishing, debate, fashion design, radio controlled transportation, or scientific visualization.</p>

    <h2><a href="Home/News.html">DigiForge Technology Conference</a></h2>
    <p>February 9, 2015 by Mr. Kapptie</p>
    <p>Thursday, March 19, 2015 8:00 am - 12:30 pm @ SLCC's South City Campus</p>
    <p>Let’s do some math.  In 2013, only 61 students in Utah took the AP Computer Science test. That same year, 35,721 AP tests were taken in Utah.  So for every 585 AP tests taken, only 1 AP CS test was taken.  Ok, you get the point.  Clearly we have some work to do to get more students into tech.  The good news is that on March 13, 2014, over 600 students will attend the DigiForge Student Conference, aka #UtahDigiCon... <a href="Home/News.html">[Read More]</a></p>
