    <p><b>Engineering Design</b> Participants (one team of three to five individuals per chapter, one entry per team) work to design and fabricate a device that will meet the specific needs of a person with a disability. Through use of a model/prototype, display, and portfolio, participants document and justify their identified problem and solution, as well as the solution’s impact on a member of their community and on society. Semifinalists justify and demonstrate their solution in a timed presentation</p>
    <p><b>Essays on Technology</b> Participants (three individuals per state) write a synthesis essay to make insightful connections based on a current technological topic.</p>
    <p><b>Extemporaneous Speech</b> Participants (three individuals per state) give a three to five minute speech fifteen minutes after having drawn a card on which a technology or TSA topic for a speech is written.</p>
    <p><b>Fashion Design</b> Participants (three teams of two to four individuals per state) research, develop, and create garment designs, garment mockups, and portfolios that reflect the current year’s published theme. Semifinalists participate in an on-site event in which they present their garment designs to judges.</p>

    <p><b>Future Technology Teacher</b> Participants (three individuals per chapter) research and select three accredited colleges or universities that offer technology education teacher preparation as a major. Each participant writes a one page simulated college essay explaining why he/she would like to become a technology educator and what would constitute success in the field. Participants also develop and present a lesson plan to judges.</p>
    <p><b>Manufacturing Prototype</b> Participants (one team per chapter) design and manufacture a prototype of a product (designated annually) and provide a description of how the product could be manufactured in a state-of-the-art American manufacturing facility.</p>
